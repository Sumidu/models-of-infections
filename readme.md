This project contains multiple files for simulation.

- seir.jl is a Pluto Notebook to explore SEIR Differential equation modeling
- abm.jl contains the Schelling Model in a Pluto Notebook and demonstrates where Pluto.jl fails
- zombie-outbreak.jl contains a OSM based infection model of a zombie outbreak in LÃ¼beck.
- network-outbreak.jl contains a simple network based model
